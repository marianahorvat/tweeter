# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. The base back-end code was provided by LHL, and forked by me. I made some modifications to the back-end code to handle linking tweets. The front-end code is by me. 

This project uses port 8080 (<http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.)
